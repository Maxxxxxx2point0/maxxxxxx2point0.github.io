      <p class="import">Star Wars the force awakens begins with the beginning story of Rey.
        Rey has become one of the many main characters in the continuing Star Wars series.
        Rey was the reason for BB-8 being <br> brought back to the rebellion, or at least the
        reason that the plot of the story could even happen. Rey is also why the
        Millennium Falcon was returned to Han Solo and Chewy.<br> Without Rey the entire
        story would unravel into a disaster ending with the First order destroying the
        galaxy back into “order” for the first time. Rey also brought Luke Skywalker back
        into the story at the end by going to return his lightsaber, but really was wanting
         to get taught in the ways of the force.<br> Because of Rey the Star Wars story continues
         to return with even more greatness with each movie.</p>
