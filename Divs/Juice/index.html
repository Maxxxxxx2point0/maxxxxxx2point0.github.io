        <h2>A Juice Box</h2>
        <p class="five">A juice box, also called a carton or popper, is a small<br>
          container used to conveniently carry and consume drinks.
          They are frequently made of paperboard with an aluminum<br>
          foil lining, but variations exist. Juice boxes are most
          popular with children, although other uses include<br>
          emergency drinking water, milk and wine.
          Ruben Rausing first created a product in 1963<br>
          that consisted of a box that would be used for
          containing liquids, more specifically, milk.<br>
          His creation was named the Tetra Brik, and
          gained popularity because the product was<br>
          efficient and a major space saver compared
          to the canisters that were previously used.<br>
          The juice box was officially incorporated in
          the U.S. market in 1980. After its introduction,<br>
          the product gained almost instant popularity and
          the market began to grow at a fast rate. According<br>
          to an article on the website E notes, in 1986, only
          six years after the productâ€™s introduction, juice boxes<br>
          accounted for 20% of the United States juice market, as
          more and more companies were introducing their own lines
          of juice boxes. </p>
