<h1><i>Apple</i> VS PC</h1>
<p>Reasons, Facts, and Opinions on why you should choose a PC over a Mac</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Why choose a PC</h3>
<blockquote>Apple can create a good product every once in a while,<br>
but the rest of the time they make overpriced computers that perform<br>
the same or worse than a pc that is a couple hundred dollars less than the price of the <a href = "https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/" target = "_blank"><b>MacBook Pro</b></a>.<br>
for example the <a href = "https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/razer-blade" target = "_blank"><b>Razer Blade 15in. laptop</b></a> starts at $1,800 with a 8th gen i7 six core processor,<br>
a gtx 1060 6gb, 16 gb of ram, a 250 gb m.2 ssd, and possible a 1tb drive. All this for 400-500 dollars cheaper<br>
than the MacBook pro that starts at $2,3000.</blockquote>
