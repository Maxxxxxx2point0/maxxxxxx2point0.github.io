<p class="Christianity">Christianity is a religion, a faith-based way of life. Numerous amounts of people around the world follow this religion.<br>
  Some are rocks in it, others are just beginning in their journey, some might even be a follower for years, but still are not <br>
  fully sold in the idea of there being a living God controlling everything. I am one of those people who are not completely sold on that idea,<br>
  but I am slowly becoming a rock in the religion. Some people might be asking God why or what next? The truth is these questions,<br>
  no one knows. We have no insight as to what will happen in the future, Jesus might not even know because of the Trinity.<br>
  God is the all-knowing, and He decides to let others know what the plan is. Yet, people are still drawn to God. <br>
  This is because they long to know that there is something out there that created everything and knows what will happen. <br>
  They want to know that they are loved and were created for a purpose. That is why Christianity is a faith-based way of life. <br>
  Not just a way of life. No one knows what will happen until it happens.</p>
