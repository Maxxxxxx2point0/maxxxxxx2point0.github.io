<p class="Morestuff">&quot;Randomness is weird, just like people.&quot; Randomness had a picture of a rabbit<br>
  and a stick figure. That was just random. Who knew that gravity changes<br>
  when you are under a blanket, actually I don't <br>know if that is applicable to real life.<br>
  and how about the pancake rabbit? Who would think of that? <br>I also found a picture of a rabbit with
  a waffle on its head.<br> The randomness of minecraft is weird. <br>
  There is a plethora of things that can be created.</p>
